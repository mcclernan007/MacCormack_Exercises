8/30:
-read preface for course layout. 
-Started reading Ch1. N-S and Euler Eqns+constitutive. Next time, potential eqn, transonic small disturbance, laplace, model eqns, and maybe first exercise (6.1)

8/31:
-Finished reading Ch1. Full Potential Eqn, Small Disturbance Transonic, Laplace-like eqns, model eqns. Also map as what chapter will deal with solving each problem.
-Read first exercise, 6.1
