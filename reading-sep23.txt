9/1/23: started ch2, read thru integral forms. Next discontinuities

9/2/23:
-read discontinuities thru simple wave eqn example. I think I get it, more or less. 
-next time burgers eqn

-Read bulk of murman cole method (6.2) I think I get it. More background reading next time, small dist transonic discontniuties, ch2, and a bit on gauss sidel line relaxation

9/8/23:
-back to reading, a few more discontinuities, jacobians. do exercises next

9/12/23:
-ex2.1-use fundamental thing for jacobians. get F in terms of U, then do it
-ex2.2-finding jacobians directly is brutal. Not sure if I found it directly incorrectly (probably), but the two aren't , matching. I can see the point though. Part 2 later
